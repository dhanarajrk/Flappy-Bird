# Flappy Bird

This is a simple clone of the popular game **Flappy Bird** developed in Java using the Swing framework. The game is played by controlling a bird that flies between a series of pipes without colliding with them.

## Features

- **Smooth Gameplay**: The bird moves with gravity, and pipes appear at random intervals, creating a challenging gameplay experience.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the score, which increases as the bird successfully passes through the pipes.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the bird collides with a pipe or falls out of the screen, the game ends and displays the final score with an option to restart the game.
- **Simple Controls**: Control the bird using the spacebar key to make it fly upwards.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `App.java` file to start the game.
2. **Control the Bird**: Press the `spacebar` key to make the bird fly upwards. Release the key to let the bird fall due to gravity.
3. **Avoid the Pipes**: Navigate the bird between the top and bottom pipes without hitting them.
4. **Score Points**: You score 1 point for each set of pipes you successfully pass.
5. **Game Over**: If the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen, the game ends. Press the `spacebar` key to restart the game.
